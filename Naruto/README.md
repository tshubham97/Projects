# Naruto #

The project will help you to get a folder of chapters in pdf format for Naruto Manga Comic without advertisment and offline. After installing the requirements packages for python you can run **naruto.py -start 1 -stop 700** Incase if stops in between due to network problem you can set the start page from the page where the error occured so that it doesn't start from beginning and saves your time. You have to delete the **naruto-images** folder if you don't have the permission to remove it.
Hope the project works fine, let me know if stuck in between   

## Before running do install:- ##

- pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage ##
```
naruto.py [--start START [START Page Number...]]
                      [--stop STOP [STOP Page Number...]]

```
